#### 1.4.0
- polling functionality changed to ensure double polling doesn't happen when the context is changed, but as node
  relies on client-sdk, we have to bump the versions.
#### 1.3.3
- listeners were not being fired when added to contexts that matched strategies. [bugfix](https://github.com/featurehub-io/featurehub-javascript-sdk/issues/196)
- all the getX methods on the Context now have defaults, so you can say fhContext.getFlag("feature", false) and if it isn't set or doesn't exist, it will return false. This is an optional field so it doesn't break existing code. (feature)
- set murmur3 hash seed value to 0 to be consistent with all SDK apis [bugfix](https://github.com/featurehub-io/featurehub/issues/1109).
#### 1.3.2
- Delete feature returns version zero which was being prevented from action by 1.3.1
#### 1.3.1
- Edge case where a feature is retired and then unretired immediately, this _can_ cause the feature to stay deleted.
#### 1.3.0
- This surfaces a fully statically typed API for Typescript clients who enforce it. Of particular interest
  is the places where `undefined` can be returned.
- Uses the featurehub-javascript-client-sdk v 1.3.0
#### 1.2.0
- update dependency to use featurehub-javascript-client-sdk v 1.2.0
- documentation update
