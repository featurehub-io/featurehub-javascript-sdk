#### 1.2.0
- Support for localstorage in a browser to cache the features
- EdgeFeatureHubConfig will now hold onto only a single context for server evaluated keys. Once created
it will always give out the same one.
- EdgeFeatureHubConfig ensures there is only one connection to the server and only one set of polling will
happen that is under its control. This ensures the React SDK for example will only have one active poll.
